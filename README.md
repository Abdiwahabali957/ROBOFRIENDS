# ROBOFRIENDS
Mini educational project created with the ZeroToMastery course
This code is a ReactJS based application that fetches a list of users from a remote API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays the information in a card format. The application allows users to search for a specific robot by name through the SearchBox component. The filtered results are displayed in the CardList component and wrapped with a Scroll component to add a scrolling effect to the display. The application also uses a CSS library called Tachyons for styling.
